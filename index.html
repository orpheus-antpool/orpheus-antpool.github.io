                    Greetings staker, your humble host is delighted you are considering this pool! If you ended up here, it means you 
                    probably care a little bit more than just your reward rate and would like to learn more about your pool. 
                    Eventually, he plans to share some of his thoughts and perhaps even short stories with you 
                    here, which hopefully will put us on a journey of building a community as we earn together. Meanwhile though, 
                    please take a few moments to allow us to argue why you should stay with us.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row text-center">
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <span class="fa-stack fa-4x">
                        <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x text-primary"></i>

                    By holding your ADA coins in your own wallet, you have already taken a step in the right direction.
                    As the saying goes, "not your keys, not your coin". But what about delegating? Is it safe to do so,
                    especially when considering smaller pool operators (like this one)? Absolutely! Unlike other networks,
                    your coins never leave your wallet, nor are they locked for the duration of the delegation. Regardless
                    of the behavior of the pool, you will never get penalized for your choice. You can freely transfer, spend and 
                    change the delegation at any time. Your delegation simply means you entrust us with your voting power,
                    which raises our chance to mint new blocks and earn rewards that we share with you. In other words, you can give 
                    us a chance to earn your trust totally risk-free.
                    </p>

                    By supporting small pool operators, you encourage a more diverse and transparent network. Saturated pools are tempting due to a constant flow of rewards. 
                    Smaller pools do not perform worse on the average though: while they have a smaller chance to mint new blocks, when they do, you will
                    receive a larger share of the rewards. Thus, you earn more less frequently. But why would you even consider this less
                    steadier alternative? For starters, it avoids concentrating the voting power in the hands of few big players, which makes
                    the network (and therefore your assets) more secure. Furthermore, saturated pools are often owned by large corporations that resort to questionable 
                    practices like sharing only a small part of the rewards with their clients. Sometimes the clients are not even aware their assets are used
                    to earn rewards. Even if this does not apply to you, your choice may prevent unethical players from taking advantage of others.

                    But there are many small pool operators out there. Why this one? For starters, your humble host has 10+ years experience
                    in Linux server administration and is committed to apply the best practices in the industry to deliver high leves of performance,
                    uptime and security. Second, this pool is hosted on embedded systems that have a minimal energy footprint, which not only 
                    saves the environment and prevents climate change, but also keeps the operating costs low. In turn, this translates to more
                    rewards for you: our fixed cost will always stay at a minimum level and our fees will always be 1%. This pool can afford it in the
                    long run. Finally, we would like to see less inequity in the world. To this end, 10% of the income will be donated to causes that
                    support education and healthcare, which we believe are the primary sources of inequity.
